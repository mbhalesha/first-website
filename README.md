# first-website

I built a personal website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used Netlify to add my site, link to my GitHub, and set it up for continuous deployment. I have included an active form on the site that collects and saves data to Netlify. When the user presses "d", the site changes to dark mode.
